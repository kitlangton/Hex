# Hex – Dev Notes for Agents

This file provides guidance for coding agents working in this repo.

## Project Overview

Hex is a macOS menu bar application for on‑device voice‑to‑text. It supports Whisper (Core ML via WhisperKit) and Parakeet TDT v3 (Core ML via FluidAudio). Users activate transcription with hotkeys; text can be auto‑pasted into the active app.

## Build & Development Commands

```bash
# Build the app
xcodebuild -scheme Hex -configuration Release

# Run tests (must be run from HexCore directory for unit tests)
cd HexCore && swift test

# Or run all tests via Xcode
xcodebuild test -scheme Hex

# Open in Xcode (recommended for development)
open Hex.xcodeproj
```

## Architecture

The app uses **The Composable Architecture (TCA)** for state management. Key architectural components:

### Features (TCA Reducers)
- `AppFeature`: Root feature coordinating the app lifecycle
- `TranscriptionFeature`: Core recording and transcription logic
- `SettingsFeature`: User preferences and configuration
- `HistoryFeature`: Transcription history management

### Dependency Clients
- `TranscriptionClient`: WhisperKit integration for ML transcription
- `RecordingClient`: AVAudioRecorder wrapper for audio capture
- `PasteboardClient`: Clipboard operations
- `KeyEventMonitorClient`: Global hotkey monitoring via Sauce framework

### Key Dependencies
- **WhisperKit**: Core ML transcription (tracking main branch)
- **FluidAudio (Parakeet)**: Core ML ASR (multilingual) default model
- **Sauce**: Keyboard event monitoring
- **Sparkle**: Auto-updates (feed: https://hex-updates.s3.amazonaws.com/appcast.xml)
- **Swift Composable Architecture**: State management
- **Inject** Hot Reloading for SwiftUI

## Important Implementation Details

1. **Hotkey Recording Modes**: The app supports both press-and-hold and double-tap recording modes, implemented in `HotKeyProcessor.swift`. See `docs/hotkey-semantics.md` for detailed behavior specifications including:
   - **Modifier-only hotkeys** (e.g., Option) use a **0.3s threshold** to prevent accidental triggers from OS shortcuts
   - **Regular hotkeys** (e.g., Cmd+A) use user's `minimumKeyTime` setting (default 0.2s)
   - Mouse clicks and extra modifiers are discarded within threshold, ignored after
   - Only ESC cancels recordings after the threshold

2. **Model Management**: Models are managed by `ModelDownloadFeature`. Curated defaults live in `Hex/Resources/Data/models.json`. The Settings UI shows a compact opinionated list (Parakeet + three Whisper sizes). No dropdowns.

3. **Sound Effects**: Audio feedback is provided via `SoundEffect.swift` using files in `Resources/Audio/`

4. **Window Management**: Uses an `InvisibleWindow` for the transcription indicator overlay

5. **Permissions**: Requires audio input and automation entitlements (see `Hex.entitlements`)

6. **Logging**: All diagnostics should use the unified logging helper `HexLog` (`HexCore/Sources/HexCore/Logging.swift`). Pick an existing category (e.g., `.transcription`, `.recording`, `.settings`) or add a new case so Console predicates stay consistent. Avoid `print` and prefer privacy annotations (`, privacy: .private`) for anything potentially sensitive like transcript text or file paths.

## Models (2025‑11)

- Default: Parakeet TDT v3 (multilingual) via FluidAudio
- Additional curated: Whisper Small (Tiny), Whisper Medium (Base), Whisper Large v3
- Note: Distil‑Whisper is English‑only and not shown by default

### Storage Locations

- WhisperKit models
  - `~/Library/Application Support/com.kitlangton.Hex/models/argmaxinc/whisperkit-coreml/<model>`
- Parakeet (FluidAudio)
  - We set `XDG_CACHE_HOME` on launch so Parakeet caches under the app container:
  - `~/Library/Containers/com.kitlangton.Hex/Data/Library/Application Support/FluidAudio/Models/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-coreml`
  - Legacy `~/.cache/fluidaudio/Models/…` is not visible to the sandbox; re‑download or import.

### Progress + Availability

- WhisperKit: native progress
- Parakeet: best‑effort progress by polling the model directory size during download
- Availability detection scans both `Application Support/FluidAudio/Models` and our app cache path

## Building & Running

- macOS 14+, Xcode 15+

### Packages

- WhisperKit: `https://github.com/argmaxinc/WhisperKit`
- FluidAudio: `https://github.com/FluidInference/FluidAudio.git` (link `FluidAudio` to Hex target)

### Entitlements (Sandbox)

- `com.apple.security.app-sandbox = true`
- `com.apple.security.network.client = true` (HF downloads)
- `com.apple.security.files.user-selected.read-write = true` (optional import)
- `com.apple.security.automation.apple-events = true` (media control)

### Cache root (Parakeet)

Set at app launch and logged:

```
XDG_CACHE_HOME = ~/Library/Containers/com.kitlangton.Hex/Data/Library/Application Support/com.kitlangton.Hex/cache
```

FluidAudio models reside under `Application Support/FluidAudio/Models`.

## UI

- Settings → Transcription Model shows a compact list with radio selection, accuracy/speed dots, size on right, and trailing menu / download‑check icon.
- Context menu offers Show in Finder / Delete.

## Troubleshooting

- Repeated mic prompts during debug: ensure Debug signing uses “Apple Development” so TCC sticks
- Sandbox network errors (‑1003): add `com.apple.security.network.client = true` (already set)
- Parakeet not detected: ensure it resides under the container path above; downloading from Hex places it correctly.

## Changelog Workflow Expectations

1. **Always add a changeset:** Any feature, UX change, or bug fix that ships to users must come with a `.changeset/*.md` fragment (run `bunx changeset`). The summary should mention the user-facing impact plus the GitHub issue/PR number (for example, “Improve Fn hotkey stability (#89)”).
2. **Keep both changelog copies in sync:** After running `changeset version` or touching `CHANGELOG.md`, run `npm run sync-changelog` (or `bun run tools/scripts/sync-changelog.ts`) so the bundled `Hex/Resources/changelog.md` stays identical. The release tool will refuse to continue if the changelog isn’t up to date.
3. **Reference GitHub issues:** When a change addresses a filed issue, link it in code comments and the changelog entry (`(#123)`) so release notes and Sparkle updates point users back to the discussion. If the work should close an issue, include “Fixes #123” (or “Closes #123”) in the commit or PR description so GitHub auto-closes it once merged.
