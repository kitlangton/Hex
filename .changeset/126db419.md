Fix hotkeys not working on macOS Sequoia by removing Input Monitoring enforcement entirely. v0.3.1 worked with ONLY Accessibility permission. Commit 7f6c5db added Input Monitoring checks in TWO places: (1) desiredMonitoringState() blocked tap creation, (2) callback guard blocked event processing. Both have been removed to restore v0.3.1 behavior. Fixes #122.
